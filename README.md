One of my Xbox gamepads randomly decided to present itself with a different vendor/product than the other (identical) three.

-sigh-

The result is that [the original Xpad](https://github.com/paroj/xpad) recognises it as a "Razer Atrox Arcade Stick", and Assault Android Cactus can't use it.

Install with (duh) `install.sh`.
